## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Syed-119/Syed-119** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


As an apprentice, I am currenlty leaning java through a course called the spring framework, which is a framwork used to make java applications. I will then be able to apply my knowldge of these concepts in projects within my company. I am proficient in some programming languages, scuh as java script, and python. I m really looking forward to learning java and familiarise myself more with some of the syntax. I would appreciate if you could reach out to me and help me become more proficient in java, perhaps though a beginners course or projects. You can reach out to me on my email: s.abbas9249@gmail.comðŸ˜„
